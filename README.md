# Screen Console

Guilherme Ranoya, 2022

## What's it?

It creates a `<div>` element copying the information shown in the browser's console.
Useful while using Live Server Preview inside Code Editors (where you can't see the browser's console)

## How to use it?

Load the library from the web if you wish:

```html
<script src="https://www.ranoya.com/Assets/JSLibs/ScreenConsole/startpanel.js"></script>
```

Or insert the [source code](https://www.ranoya.com/Assets/JSLibs/ScreenConsole/startpanel.js) inside the `<script>` tag in your `<head>`.
